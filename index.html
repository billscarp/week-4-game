<!--- pseudocode:

1.	The computer will show a random number between 19 â€“ 120.
2.	Have four crystals on the screen that the player can pick from.
3.	Set up each crystal as a variable that equals a specific amount of points, not seen by the user yet.
4.	They will need to click on one of the four crystals. (keyup.event I think) **ask during study group.
5.	When they click on a crystal, the players score counter will be updated accordingly.
6.	If players score = value of original random number, the player wins.
7.	Otherwise (else) if the value is above the amount of the original random number, the player loses.
8.	If player wins or loses game will be reset to 0,  and a new random number will appear.
9.	The values of the four crystals will be reset to new numbers.(hidden from player)
10.	User score will = 0
11.	Score counter will = 0
12.	Insert a counter to record number of wins and loses.
